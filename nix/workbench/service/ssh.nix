    # arguments are any (the default), inet (use IPv4 only), or inet6 (use
    # IPv6 only).
    AddressFamily inet

    # Specifies whether ssh-agent(1) forwarding is permitted. The default
    # is "yes". Note that disabling agent forwarding does not improve
    # security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can
    # always install their own for‚Äêwarders.

    # DenyGroups, AllowGroups.
    # See PATTERNS in ssh_config(5) for more information on patterns.
    # AllowGroups

    # Specifies whether StreamLocal (Unix-domain socket) forwarding is
    # permitted. The available options are yes (the default) or all to
    # allow StreamLocal forwarding, no to prevent all StreamLocal
    # forwarding, local to allow local (from the perspective of ssh(1))

    # disabling StreamLocal forwarding does not improve security unless
    # users are also denied shell access, as they can always install their

    # all TCP forwarding, local to allow local (from the perspective of

    # AllowUsers.
    # See PATTERNS in ssh_config(5) for more information on patterns.

    # Specifies the authentication methods that must be successfully
    # completed for a user to be granted access. This option must be
    # followed by one or more lists of comma-separated authentication
    # method names, or by the single string any to indicate the default
    # behaviour of accepting any single authentication method. If the
    # default is overridden, then successful authentication requires
    # completion of every method in at least one of these lists.
    # For example, Qq publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive
    # would require the user to complete public key authentication,
    # followed by either password or keyboard interactive authentication.
    # Only methods that are next in one or more lists are offered at each
    # stage, so for this example it  would not be possible to attempt
    # password or keyboard-interactive authentication before public key.
    # For keyboard interactive authentication it is also possible to
    # restrict authentication to a specific device by appending a colon
    # followed by the device identifier bsdauth or pam. depending on the
    # server configuration. For example, Qq keyboard-interactive:bsdauth
    # would restrict keyboard interactive authentication to the bsdauth
    # device.
    # If the publickey method is listed more than once, sshd(8) verifies
    # that keys that have been used successfully are not reused for
    # subsequent authentications. For example, Qq publickey,publickey
    # requires successful authentication using two different public keys.
    # Note that each authentication method listed should also be
    # explicitly enabled in the configuration.
    # The available authentication methods are: Qq gssapi-with-mic,
    # Qq hostbased, Qq keyboard-interactive, Qq none (used for access to
    # password-less accounts when PermitEmptyPasswords is enabled),
    # Qq password and Qq publickey.
    AuthenticationMethods publickey

    # AuthorizedKeysCommand
    # AuthorizedKeysCommandUser

    # Specifies the file that contains the public keys used for user
    # authentication. The format is described in the AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE
    # FORMAT section of sshd(8). Arguments to AuthorizedKeysFile accept
    # the tokens described in the TOKENS section. After expansion,
    # AuthorizedKeysFile is taken to be an absolute path or one relative
    # to the user's home directory. Multiple files may be listed,
    # separated by whitespace. Alternately this option may be set to none
    # to skip checking for user keys in files. The default is

    # before authentication is allowed. If the argument is none then no
    # banner is displayed.
    # By default, no banner is displayed.
    Banner none

    # CASignatureAlgorithms

    # Specifies the pathname of a directory to chroot(2) to after
    # authentication. At session startup sshd(8) checks that all
    # components of the pathname are root-owned directories which are not
    # writable by any other user or group. After the chroot, sshd(8)
    # changes the working directory to the user's home directory.
    # Arguments to ChrootDirectory accept the tokens described in the
    # TOKENS section.
    # The ChrootDirectory must contain the necessary files and directories
    # to support the user's session. For an interactive session this
    # requires at least a shell, typically sh(1), and basic /dev nodes
    # such as null(4), zero(4), stdin(4), stdout(4), stderr(4), and tty(4)
    # devices. For file transfer sessions using SFTP no additional
    # configuration of the environment is necessary if the in-process
    # sftp-server is used, though sessions which use logging may require
    # /dev/log inside the chroot directory on some operating systems (see
    # sftp-server(8) for details).
    # For safety, it is very important that the directory hierarchy be
    # prevented from modification by other processes on the system
    # (especially those outside the jail). Misconfiguration can lead to
    # unsafe environments which sshd(8) cannot detect.
    ChrootDirectory none

    # Ciphers

    # Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without
    # sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this
    # threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent,
    # sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is
    # important to note that the use of client alive messages is very
    # different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent
    # through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable.
    # The TCP keepalive option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The
    # client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend
    # on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.
    # The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and
    # ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients
    # will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero
    # ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.
    ClientAliveCountMax 3

    # Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been
    # received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the
    # encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default
    # is 0, indicating that  these messages will not be sent to the
    # client.
    ClientAliveInterval 30

    # Specifies whether compression is enabled after the user has

    # originally supplied by the client is available in the
